abstract: "The \\(p\\)% rule classifies an aggregate statistic as a disclosure risk if one contributor can use the statistic to determine another contributor&rsquo;s value to within \\(p\\)%. This is often possible in economic data when there is a monopoly or a duopoly. Therefore, the \\(p\\)% rule is an important statistical disclosure control and is frequently used in national statistical organisations. However, the \\(p\\)% rule is only a method for assessing disclosure risk: While it can say whether a statistic is risky or not, it does not provide a mechanism to decrease that risk. To address this limitation, we encode the \\(p\\)% rule into a formal privacy definition using the Pufferfish framework and we develop a perturbation mechanism which is provably private under this framework. This mechanism provides official statisticians with a method for perturbing data which guarantees a Bayesian formulation of the \\(p\\)% rule is satisfied. We motivate this work with an example application to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)."

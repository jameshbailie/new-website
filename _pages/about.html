Back in 2020, I did an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211021072017/https://officialstatistics.com/news-blog/2020-young-statisticians-prize-award-winner-james-bailie">interview with the IAOS</a> and was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/absstats_humansofabs-activity-6669099183636660224-tg-l">profiled on the ABS's LinkedIn page</a>. More recently, I was approached by <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-05-29/harvard-university-trump-administration-australian-students/105345932">some media</a> <a href="https://whowhatwhy.org/apprentice-stories/i-cant-go-back-trump-and-the-new-american-brain-drain/">outlets</a> about leaving US academia under Trump.
